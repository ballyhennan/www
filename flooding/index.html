          <p>A few things to note:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>I get 6-10 bad flooding events like this every year. Most occur in autumn and winter.</li>
            <li>I have sandbags down 365 days a year to divert flood water into my house drainage.</li>
            <li>Sometimes the amount of flood water is so great it tops the sandbags that I use direct the water into my house drainage.</li>
            <li>I also have sandbags down the side of my house to stop the really bad flooding getting under my house.</li>
            <li>Even with the sandbags at the side of my house, the water has started to eat away at the stone of my house (more below).</li>

          <h2>Most Recent Flooding</h2>
            <p>This flooding took place after the recent spell of bad weather and after the SSE crew cleared the small burn above my house (shown on map below).</p>

          <p>The image below shows what the SSE land directly above my house currently looks like on a dry day (a hole of water reflecting the trees above).</p>        
          <p>Your colleague Neil had a look at the area and thought it could be a burst large field drain, which would explain the amount of water cascading into my garden.</p>             
          <p>Neil dug down, but in the time available, he couldn't find a pipe. We think it could be many feet down.</p>        
          <p>As you can see in the picture below, this area/hole is always full of water. Even after our very dry summer this year, the area had water in it.</p>

            <li>B is: the always-flooded area your colleague Neil dug down suspecting a broken/burst field drain.</li>
            <li>C is: a possible new drainage trench that we discussed with your colleague Neil. It would run the back of the houses into the burn between houses No.15 and No.17</li>
